# GroupProject1 :- Birthday tribute to our Guru

This project is an outcome of 11 group members, 8 months of understanding of OpenGL under guidance of ***Dr. V. Gokhale @ ASTROMEDICOMP***, Pune, India.
Below is the short Synopsis of the project

**Group Name :  Render Group**

**Group Leader : Bharat Mazire**

**Purpose**:   Our main goal is  to give birthday wishes to sir through OpenGL FFP demo. 

**Background**:   Use the concepts which we learnt in FFP are implemented in this demo.

**Problem Statement**:  
To create a digital greeting using OpenGL fixed function pipeline. Project should involve basic shapes, transformations, background music, revolving around common themes i.e Sir’s birthday and Vijayadashami festival.

***Solution*** :  
Multiple ideas were taken from each group member, and a most suitable and aggregable theme was evolved and finalized. Work was divided among group members with defined timelines.
Follow up meetings are scheduled to keep track of work progress and resolving blocking points.
And finally, the idea is converted into the digital greeting with guidance from the group leader and knowledge gained from class up till now with a pinch of the group's imagination.
